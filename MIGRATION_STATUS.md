# PostgreSQL Migration Status

## Current State: File-Based Storage
- Data stored in `data/storage.json`
- Each deployment instance has separate data
- Perfect for development, not suitable for multi-user production

## Migration Benefits
- **Shared Data**: All users see consistent data across different systems
- **Zero Functionality Loss**: All assessments work exactly the same
- **Complete Data Preservation**: Every ROM measurement, quality score, and timestamp preserved
- **Production Ready**: Supports multiple concurrent users

## Data That Gets Preserved
- 9 assessments for DEMO01 with detailed ROM breakdowns
- TAM finger-specific measurements (middle: 226.7°, ring: 238.21°, etc.)
- Kapandji scores and wrist angle measurements
- Quality scores and completion timestamps
- Motion replay data and assessment history
- User progress tracking and streaks

## Migration Process
1. PostgreSQL database schema already configured
2. Migration script preserves all existing data
3. System seamlessly switches to database storage
4. All APIs and interfaces remain identical

## Result
- Same assessment functionality
- Same user experience
- Consistent data across all deployments
- Production-grade scalability
